# AWS Serverless Reference Architecture for AWS Global Accelerator with Reverse Proxy

# Why Reverse Proxy on AWS Fargate
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute service that helps container orchestration services such as Amazon ECS to provision containers without managing any EC2 instances. This repo aims to run Reverse Proxy in a serverless environment as a middle stack between AWS Global Accelerator and the endpoints you want to pass through the proxy.
